Suggested citation: European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control and European Food Safety Authority. Multi - country outbreak of  Salmonella Enteritidis infections linked to Polish eggs, 1 2 December 2017. ECDC and EFSA:  Stockholm and Parma; 2017. © Eur opean Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, European Food Safety Authority, Stockholm. 201 7  Conclusions  and options for response A multi - country outbreak of  Salmonella Enteritidis linked to eggs from Poland is ongoing in the EU/EEA.  Testing through whole genome sequencing (WGS ) shows the isolates are part of four distinct but related  genetic clusters. ECDC and EFSA are liaising with relevant authorities in the  affected EU/EEA countries  and the  European Commission to facilitate the coordination of investigation and response measures. From 1 February 2017 to 2 8 November 2017,  eight EU/EEA count ries have reported 1 9 6 confirmed cases  of  Salmonella Enteritidis  belonging to four distinct WGS clusters, and  72 probable cases sharing one of the six  S. Enteritidis  m ultiple  l ocus  v ariable - n umber  t andem  r epeat  a nalysis ( MLVA ) outbreak profiles. Outbreak c ases,  both confirmed and probable, have been reported by Belgium, the Czech Republic, France, Luxembourg, the  Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and the United Kingdom. In addition, 340 historical  confirmed cases and 3 74 historical probable cases were reported be fore February 2017 by 16 countries (the previously listed  eight countries plus Croatia, Denmark, Finland , Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy and Slovenia ). The United Kingdom  has reported the  most cases (166 confirmed and three probable). Additional  S . Enteri tidis cases have recently been reported by some of the above - mentioned EU countries but  molecular typing results are pending. The European outbreak case definition  is based on a limited number of  S . Enteritidis  geno types ( four  WGS  clusters  for the definiti on of confirmed cases and  six  MLVA  profiles  for the definition of probable cases), and is  therefore extremely specific. In countries where MLVA or WGS is not undertaken routinely, additional cases are  unlikely to be recognised as  associated  with this outbr eak.  An analysis of confirmed cases with a travel history  to Bulgaria and Portugal in spring and summer 2017 shows that these two countries were probably affected by  the outbreak. Available evidence from epidemiological, microbiological and tracing investi gations linked t he cases in Sweden  to consumption of eggs originating from one packing centre and two laying hen farms in Poland . The  Norwegian egg product  isolate was traced back to  another packing centre and another laying hen farm in  Poland. Information from investigations in the United Kingdom to date was not sufficient to identify the  vehicle  of infection for all cases, but for some cases t he eggs  identified as the  likely  source  w ere traced back to a  Polish  laying hen farm. So far, no epidemiological c onnection has been identified between the four Polish farms  and the two Polish packing centres involved in Swedish, Norwegian and British investigations. However, some  food business operators involved in the event investigated in Norway, and one possibly i nvolved in the  investigations in the United Kingdom, were also implicated in the 2016 outbreak linked to Polish eggs  [1] . The  collection of more epidemiological information would support a more precise assessment. JOINT RAPID OUTBREAK ASSESSMENT
