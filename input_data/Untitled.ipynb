    "1. Make a copy of this repo. \n",
    "2. In the repo copy replace the files in the ``raw`` folder with examples from the new data set to train on.\n",
    "3. From the command line navigate to the ``input_data`` directory, then:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash \n",
    "$ python preprocess_dataset.py\n",
    "$ python make_datasplit.py\n",
    "$ python text_to_int.py\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Training ###\n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "To train the model run make_lstm_classifier.py from the directory it is located in. \n",
    "```bash\n",
    "$ python make_lstm_classifier.py\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will take several hours to days to complete training depending on the size of the data set \n",
    "and the hardware on your system. \n",
    "For the 31,000 article dataset training on 3 epochs completed in about 15 hours using a single GPU. \n",
    "Training on the CPU will take significantly longer. \n",
    "\n",
    "To confirm that the model has trained sufficiently run:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "$ python lstm_classifier.py\n",
    "```\n",
    "    \n",
    "The accuracy should be in the high 90 percent range. \n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "## Performance ##\n",
    "Timing for 3000 articles sequentially pre-processed and predicted: 137 seconds (CPU), 70 seconds (GPU)\n"
