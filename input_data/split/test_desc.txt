<SOD> following is a question by dr the hon priscilla leung and a written reply by the secretary for transport and housing , professor anthony cheung bing - leung , in the legislative council today ( february <NUMERIC> question : a a a a a the mtr kwun tong line extension ( kte which includes ho man tin station and whampoa station , was commissioned on october <NUMERIC> last year . a according to the information provided by the mtr corporation limited ( mtrcl the average daily number of person - times travelling to and from the two new stations in the first five weeks after the commissioning of kte was around <NUMERIC> <NUMERIC> . a in this connection , will the government inform this council : a ( <NUMERIC> ) a given that ho man tin station has been built on hillside and consists of as many as eight levels , passengers travelling from the station entrance at chung hau street ( i . e . exit <ALPHANUMERIC> ) to the platform on the lowest level have to take five lifts or walk down , and the journey takes as long as <NUMERIC> minutes , whether the authorities will request mtrcl to take measures ( e . g . increasing the current fare discount of $ <NUMERIC> . <NUMERIC> for passengers interchanging with the green minibus feeder route no . <ALPHANUMERIC> , or installing mtr fare savers , which offer a $ <NUMERIC> concessionary fare , at the oi man shopping centre adjacent to oi man estate and chun man court ) to attract residents near the station to travel on mtr ; a ( <NUMERIC> ) a as some residents have pointed out that some of the footbridges and passageways connecting to ho man tin station ( e . g . the footbridge at chung yee street and fat kwong street , the podium floor of po man house ) are not covered or lack barrier - free access facilities ( e . g . guiding paths for the blind whether the authorities will retrofit covers and provide barrier - free access facilities for such pedestrian facilities and passageways to avoid passengers being tormented by the elements and facilitate persons with disabilities to travel on mtr ; if they will , of the details ; if not , the reasons for that ; and ( <NUMERIC> ) a as some whampoa residents have relayed that the reinstatement works for traffic lanes and footpaths being carried out in the vicinity of whampoa station have caused inconvenience to residents , and odours emitted from the works sites have caused physical discomfort to the passers - by , whether the authorities will urge mtrcl to complete the works expeditiously ; if they will , of the details ; if not , the reasons for that ? a reply : a president , a a a a a the mtr kwun tong line extension ( kte being the extension of the existing railway networks owned by the mtr corporation limited ( mtrcl is an " ownership " project . a under the " ownership " approach , the mtrcl is responsible for the financing , design , construction and operation of the railway project , and owns the railway . a to tie in with the commissioning of the kte , the government entrusted the mtrcl with the construction of the government - funded associated essential public infrastructure works ( epiw ) concurrently with the construction of the kte . a the epiw included the construction and enhancement of the pedestrian and linking facilities for providing convenient access to ho man tin station so that the consequential social and economic benefits of the railways can be fully realised . a the facilities can also provide an all - weather comfortable walking environment for residents who would be able to travel with ease between ho man tin uphill and hung hom area downhill . a the footbridges and pedestrian links concerned , partially completed for use in mid - december , became fully open to the public when the kte was put into operation on october <NUMERIC> a a a a a a my reply to the three parts of dr thea hon priscilla leung ' s question is as follows : a ( <NUMERIC> ) a ho man tin station is one of the major interchange stations and train hubs . a it provides interchange with the kwun tong line ( ktl ) and the future shatin to central link ( scl a after the commissioning of the scl , passengers can make use of ho man tin station and transfer to ktl to get to central or east kowloon , or take the scl to reach various destinations in the new territories . a alternatively , passengers at ho man tin station may ride to admiralty station across the harbour and transfer to other railway lines to reach other destinations in north hong kong island and the southern district . a a a a a as ho man tin station is built on hillside , and to cater for the alignment of the ktl and scl deep underground , ho man tin station has a vertical difference of over <NUMERIC> metres . a as such , there are three lifts and two lifts respectively at the station entrances on chung hau street and fat kwong street uphill connecting to the pedestrian subways to ho man tin station . a there are also a number of escalators and lifts to facilitate the residents to travel between pedestrian subways , station concourse and platforms at various levels . a a a a a as regards fare concessions , the mtrcl advises that the corporation has been offering fare discounts for different passenger groups through the implementation of various kinds of fare concession and promotion schemes . a to promote the use of the kte , the mtrcl has introduced a twelve - month aintermodal discountsa in collaboration with the operators of green minibus ( gmb a during the promotion period , adult octopus users interchanging between three designated gmb routes ( <ALPHANUMERIC> , <ALPHANUMERIC> and <ALPHANUMERIC> ) and mtr at ho man tin station can enjoy a $ <NUMERIC> . <NUMERIC> fare discount . a the discount is applicable to the trips interchanging from mtr to gmb or vice versa . a the mtrcl will review together with gmb operators the effectiveness of the concessions from time to time and explore the possibility of further collaboration in providing other interchange discounts . a a a a the mtr fare saver is a promotion scheme launched by the mtrcl . according to the mtrcl , with the aim of attracting new customers , the scheme seeks to encourage passengers to walk to nearby mtr stations to take mtr . a at present , there are <NUMERIC> mtr fare savers under the scheme . a passengers who register their adult octopus card at the mtr fare savers can enjoy a discount of $ <NUMERIC> on their next mtr ride at designated stations ( note a when considering the setting up of mtr fare savers , the mtrcl will take into account such factors as passenger volume of individual mtr stations and the railway network , pedestrian flow in the vicinity of stations , ancillary transport infrastructure , etc . a the mtrcl will also consider whether basic installation requirements , such as whether there are adequate space and power supply , can be met at proposed venues for the mtr fare savers . a regarding the proposal for addition of mtr fare savers near ho man tin station , the mtrcl will examine its feasibility based on all the aforesaid factors . a ( <NUMERIC> ) the epiw for kte , the construction of which was entrusted to the mtrcl , included new footbridges , walkways and lift towers connecting mtr ho man tin station with oi man estate and ho man tin estate , all of which are covered . a to cater for the needs of the visually impaired , the mtrcl installed tactile warning strips at the exits of walkways and lifts , and at the top and bottom of staircases in accordance with the technical guidelines of the transport department ( td a a furthermore , at the request of the td , to facilitate visually impaired persons to travel between ho man tin station and the service centre of the hong kong blind union at kar man house of oi man estate , a tactile guide path was installed on the footpath en route where necessary . a as far as the above epiw are concerned , since the kerbs , balustrades and side walls on both sides of the footbridges at chung yee street and fat kwong street can serve as cues for guiding the visually impaired according to the technical guidelines of the td , it is not necessary to provide tactile guide paths on the footbridges . a a a a a the current - term government promotes the universal accessibility programme and strives to improve road facilities and install suitable barrier - free facilities . a after the opening of the kte in october last year , the td and the highways department ( hyd ) conducted a site visit together with the hong kong blind union in november . a the union was briefed of the design standard for the tactile guide paths and their views were sought on the existing facilities . a in the light of the views of the union , the td and the hyd reviewed the design of barrier - free facilities of the pedestrian link system . a to further enhance ease of travel for the visually impaired , the td and the hyd will install additional tactile guide paths and tactile warning strips at appropriate locations in both exit <ALPHANUMERIC> of ho man tin station and the exit of the new lift tower beside kar man house of oi man estate . a the works concerned are expected to be completed by the middle of this year . a a a a as regards the podium areas adjacent to po man house of oi man estate , the housing department ( hd ) will carry out detailed design and implementation works for extending the tactile guide paths to the new lift tower beside kar man house of oi man estate . a the works concerned are expected to be completed by the middle of this year . a the hd will also conduct a feasibility study for the proposed covered walkway . a a ( <NUMERIC> ) since early last year , the mtrcl has been carrying out the laying works of the underground utilities , backfilling and road reinstatement works around whampoa station . a in last october , the mtrcl identified blockage and defects in the public sewer at the junction of hung hom road and tak on street within the site boundary . a the contractor engaged by the mtrcl has carried out replacement works for the defective sewer . a during the repairing works , the contractor adopted appropriate measures at the site to minimise the impact of the defective sewer and the repairing works on the nearby environment . a such measures included erecting barriers , setting up additional ventilation facilities , and diverting sewage flowing through the defective sewer . a in last november , the mtrcl identified blockage and suspected defects in a section of the existing public sewer at hung hom road near whampoa garden site <NUMERIC> on the periphery of the works site . a the mtrcl is currently discussing follow - up actions and repairing matters with relevant government department . a a a a a the hyd will keep the issues concerned in view , and has requested the mtrcl to expedite the sewer repairing works for improving the site environmental hygiene . a the hyd expects progressive completion of most of the installation works of underground utilities connection works , backfilling and road reinstatement works around whampoa station within the first quarter of this year . a however , the road reinstatement works for the road sections affected by the afore - mentioned drainage repairing works are expected to be completed later in the second quarter of this year . note : the mtr fare saver for ho man tin station and whampoa station is located at ka wai chuen shopping arcade . <EOD>

<SOD> author : a afptue <ALPHANUMERIC> : a beirut as syriaas war approaches its seventh year , two new rounds of talks on resolving the conflict are scheduled to take place in astana and geneva . here are some questions and answers about the upcoming talks : the first meeting is in the kazakh capital astana , and is expected to build on talks held there last month sponsored by the syrian governmentas allies russia and iran , and rebel backer turkey . the kazakh foreign ministry said representatives from the government and armed rebels , as well as un envoy staffan de mistura and us officials , would be invited to the talks on wednesday and thursday . russian foreign minister sergei lavrov on monday said the astana meeting would be a chance to amonitor the commitment of different parties to refrain from using force and to promote , encourage , the political process . aa syrian source close to the government said the discussions in astana would be apurely military . aby comparison , a second meeting in geneva now scheduled for feb . <NUMERIC> and sponsored by the un is expected to focus on the key issues that divide the two sides , including the fate of president bashar assad . the talks in geneva , the fifth time the parties have gone to switzerland , have been pushed back twice already , in part to give the opposition more time to form a unified delegation . moscow says the astana process is meant to support the geneva talks , but there has been speculation that it is working with ankara to develop an alternative aastana track . aain theory , it is a complement to a still - live ongoing geneva process , a said sam heller , a non - resident fellow at the century foundation think - tank . abut in practice it looks like itas a venue for turkey , russia , and to some extent iran , to arrive at their own understandings and to try to engineer a mutually satisfactory political solution on their terms . athe syrian government has indicated it will attend the geneva talks , and its delegation is likely to be led by its usual negotiator , syriaas un ambassador bashar al - jaafari . the key opposition high negotiations committee has announced a <NUMERIC> - member opposition delegation to geneva , including <NUMERIC> rebel representatives . a new chief opposition negotiator , lawyer mohammed sabra , replaces mohamed alloush of the army of islam rebel group , which said it would participate in the delegation in an advisory capacity . the hnc touted the delegation as aunifieda and said it includes representatives from two rival opposition groupings known informally as the cairo and moscow groups . but both denied being represented , and it remains unclear if they will seek to attend in separate delegations . attendance at the astana talks is more uncertain , though syriaas government is being represented by jaafari who has already arrived in least four rebel groups told afp they had not yet received an invitation to the meeting , and several cast doubt on whether they would attend if misturaas office said he would send a atechnical team , a and the us state department said it was still weighing whether to send a representative . jordan said it would attend the astana talks as an observer . the goal of the astana talks has been narrowly defined , primarily to reinforce the cease - fire brokered by turkey and russia in place since dec . <NUMERIC> . but with rebel attendance uncertain and the last meeting in astana producing no major breakthrough , talks there seem unlikely to shift the conversation on the peace process . meanwhile , in geneva , all the main divisions between the two sides remain to be resolved , key among them assadas fate . the opposition insists he must step aside , but his government says his future is not a topic for negotiations . rebel backer turkey has signalled new flexibility on resolving the syrian conflict but there is little sign the opposition feels the same way . syriaas government also comes to the talks on the back of recent victories , including the full recapture of second city aleppo in december , which may leave it less open to compromise . ai still donat believe the loyalist alliance is serious about making some serious compromise , rather than asking for the rebelsa surrender disguised as a political settlement , a said thomas pierret , a syria expert at the university of edinburgh . athey will try to obtain such surrender , which is why the talks will take place . a agence france pressemain category : a middle - east <EOD>

summer as we have again this summer . a a the <NUMERIC> cases reported on thursday have not yet been added to the cdc ' s total , and a brief notice posted on the maryland health department website now indicates the number of suspected cases has risen to <NUMERIC> . influenza a ( <ALPHANUMERIC> ) variant virus background the maryland department of health has presumptively identified the influenza virus strain <ALPHANUMERIC> ( variant flu ) in maryland residents who had close contact with pigs at the charles county fair . none of the infected individuals has developed serious illness or been hospitalized . a influenza is an infection caused by the influenza virus which can affect people and other animals , including pigs and birds . symptoms for the <ALPHANUMERIC> strain are the same as seasonal flu and include fever and respiratory symptoms , such as sore throat and cough . historically , there is limited human to human transmission from this strain of variant flu . the treatment recommendations for this strain of influenza are the same as for seasonal flu . a it is recommended that people with influenza - like illness contact their healthcare provider and inform them if they have had pig contact within the past seven days . providers are advised to contact their local health departments if they suspect variant flu in their patients to coordinate appropriate testing with their local health department . for local health department contact information , visit : amaryland cases ( as of september <NUMERIC> <NUMERIC> presumptive positive casesin an attempt to better quantify the size of this outbreak , the maryland department of health has issued a letter to clinicians with guidance for testing and reporting . an excerpt from the letter describes when testing is appropriate : when to suspect variant influenza virusa variant influenza virus infection cannot be distinguished by clinical features from seasonal influenza virus infection , or from infection with other respiratory viruses that can cause influenza - like illness ( fever and either cough or sore throat therefore , the key to suspecting variant virus infection in an ill patient is to elicit an epidemiological link to recent swine exposure in the <NUMERIC> days prior to illness onset , specifically : direct contact with swine ( e . g showing swine , raising swine , feeding swine , or cleaning swine waste orclose contact ( within <NUMERIC> meters or approximately <NUMERIC> feet ) with an ill person who had recent swine exposure or is known to be infected with a variant virus . a weaker epidemiological link would be : indirect exposure to swine ( e . g visiting a swine farm or walking through a swine barn especially if swine were known to be illwe ' ve seen studies in the past suggesting that only a fraction of cases are ever identifieda ( see cid journal : estimates of human infection from <ALPHANUMERIC> ( jul - apr and while <ALPHANUMERIC> is viewed as having only low to moderate pandemic potential , the cdc is always keen to investigate whenever a zoonotic virus like swine <ALPHANUMERIC> jumps species . while both local and state health departments are reporting no serious illnesses or hospitilzations , several local media outlets are reporting on an <NUMERIC> - year - old girl hospitalized with swine flu after attending charles county fair , mother says . while normally mild , serious illness and even deaths have occasionally been reported with swine variant infections ( see here , here , and here despite a long history of exposure to seasonal <ALPHANUMERIC> flu viruses , research has shown only limited community immunity to these variant strains ( see cidrap : children & middle -

like symptoms and the fair board was alerted . the childas parents told doctors that they had been at the fair and around pigs continue we should know more about this incident , and whether it is related to a swine variant virus , in the next few days . while the evidence is still circumstantial , maryland officials are obviously operating with an abundance of caution . a with state and county fair season continuing into the fall , it would not be unexpected to see additional , scattered reports of swine variant infection from around the nation . <ALPHANUMERIC> is the most common swine variant virus reported in the united states , but is far from the only swine flu virus of concern . co -

in addition , the general licence for bird gatherings has been amended , such that gatherings with poultry or captive birds of the anseriforme and galliforme orders are expected , more findings of wild birds testing positive for the <ALPHANUMERIC> hpai virus have been made . all wild bird positives will be published on a weekly basis on the apha website at exceptional reports in new regions or unusual wild bird findings ( ie a change to the disease epidemiology ) will be officially reported on an ad hoc basis . situation assessmentnew countries in the eu reporting disease are portugal in wild birds and belgium in captive birds . elsewhere , uganda has also reported <ALPHANUMERIC> hpai in wild birds and poultry ;
