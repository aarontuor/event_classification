whatas new and different about the numbers this year ? weave answered a few common questions below . read on to discover the answers . and , make sure you take some time to explore the data and the stories of the lives behind the numbers in feed the futureas new interactive report . what makes this report different than past ones ? this yearas report is groundbreaking : it shares feed the futureas traditional output and outcome results , but also includes data that suggest that these results , along with others achieved by related u . s . government efforts , are contributing to drops in poverty and malnutritionafeed the futureas top goals . other contributors include host country governments , other u . s . government programs , and development partners . this is our first glimpse into where the results weave reported since a such as the number of farmers applying new technologies , the value of their sales , and the number of people trained in nutrition a are leading : to true changes in the wellbeing and livelihoods of the people with whom we work . why do we have this kind of impact data now ? stakeholders have been anxiously awaiting this story for a few years , but impacts and data on them both take time . transformation doesnat happen overnight . we conducted interim surveys and assessed key indicators about three years after baselines were established in the areas where feed the future works a what we call azones of influencea a to give our programs time to work . surveys collected and indicators assessed this year provide a second data point to establish trends in poverty and malnutrition when compared to the baseline . as youall see in this yearas digital report , we also projected trend lines to , when we will conduct the next set of surveys and analyze data to give us a third data point . the data weare publishing this year suggest that feed the future can meet its ambitious goal of reducing poverty and stunting by an average of <NUMERIC> percent each across the areas where the initiative works . how did you calculate the impact data ? we calculated the impact numbers using household survey data , such as feed the futureas own population - based surveys , the demographic and health surveys ( dhs ) and the living standards measurement study integrated survey in agriculture . in each country where data were available , we looked for a way to most accurately assess changes in poverty and stunting in areas where feed the future programs were working and to which we would have contributed . in many cases , we used data from national level surveys , such as the dhs , to assess changes that have occurred in poverty or stunting overall in the countries where we work , such as in ethiopia and ghana . in other countries , where data were reported at sub - national levels , such as by province , we calculated values for the areas which most closely aligned with feed the future zones of influence , such as for stunting in kenya or bangladesh . and , where we had full data sets for the zone of influence , as in the case of bangladeshas poverty data , we calculated the change in the zone . while there are varying levels of exactness in these methods , in all cases , the data and changes reported give us strong indications that feed the future is contributing to positive impact . werenat these downward trends in poverty and malnutrition already happening ? the trend lines weare seeing in the data currently available exceed whatas happened historically in these countries and our zones of influence , particularly for stunting . trends in childhood stunting reductions each year have doubled , from <NUMERIC> percent per year in when the initiativeas activities began to ramp up to <NUMERIC> percent per year , on average across five feed the future countries where data is available . for poverty , weare still waiting to receive data from more countries to determine if and how feed the future may have accelerated poverty reduction , which weall publish later this year . weare conducting additional studies and analysis , such as impact evaluations , to examine how our programs are affecting poverty and malnutrition , but the increasing scale of the results weare achieving each year signal that the united states is contributing to impact on poverty and malnutrition . you can dig a little deeper into the data thatas currently available in our interactive report at . since feed the futureas approach is proving to be a successful one , why isnat the initiative working in more countries , such as south sudan , which is facing a hunger crisis as we speak ? one of the reasons we ' ve been able to be successful is that we haven ' t tried to do all things in all places . instead , we took a very selective , strategic and focused approach to support specific countries through feed the future . we looked at where these countries were already interested in investing and where we could come alongside them and maximize that work . you need a certain level of government commitment and capacity for improving agriculture in order to have that type of partnership . that doesnat mean we donat work in countries that have great need but may lack certain aspects of capacity or commitment . we have a set of aligned countries in which feed the future operates a though in more limited scope than focus countries a that have a high need for food security - related activities and opportunity for u . s . support to make an impact . often , these countries are reached through regional feed the future activities related to trade and research . these include countries such as burma , nigeria , and south sudan . this past year , we added sierra leone and guinea to this list as well , given how hard their agriculture sectors were hit during the fallout from the ebola crisis , and the opportunity that agriculture provides to strengthen those countries and help alleviate the conditions that allow a single outbreak to turn into an epidemic . humanitarian assistance in times of crisis will always be importantaand the united states will continue to be a world leader in providing emergency aid to alleviate acute suffering . but weare also working to strengthen countriesa and communitiesa resilience and help lessen the occurrence of shocks and the devastation they can cause to vulnerable families when they do hit . feed the future is all about a long - term approach to address the root causes of poverty and hunger so families can move out of them , for good . so , whatas next for feed the future ? the impact data this year tells us that u . s . government leadership has made a difference since and . feed the future has built on resources allocated during the george w . bush administration to boost agricultural productivity in africa , and itas encouraging to see strong bipartisan support today for reducing global hunger , poverty and malnutrition . in fact , members in the u . s . senate and house of representatives have introduced legislation this year to authorize and codify international food security programs . momentum is strong , but there is still more to do . the <NUMERIC> million people who go to bed hungry every night deserve nothing less than our full commitment to ensuring progress toward the millennium development goals continues through achievement of the sustainable development goals , which will be announced later this year . in the year ahead , you can expect to see more impact data from feed the future as more survey data become available and we are able to calculate values in poverty and stunting for additional feed the future countries . and , as i mentioned before , weall be publishing future evaluations to continue to share how our programs are working and how well weare fulfilling the presidentas promise to help farms aand the smallholders that tend themain poor nations flourish . <EOD>

<SOD> # <NUMERIC> , <ALPHANUMERIC> has dealt with dozens outbreaks of hpai <ALPHANUMERIC> since last spring , with the most recent reported from moscow oblast a week ago ( see russia notifies oie of a new <ALPHANUMERIC> outbreak in moscow oblast a authorities have also been tracing the entry of ai contaminated products into the retail food chain ( see july <ALPHANUMERIC> ' s rosselkhoznadzor finds more hpai contaminated meat in retail stores ) since may . add in the rapid spread of <ALPHANUMERIC> in china to their south - reported in june to be within <NUMERIC> km of the russian border - and it is little wonder that the russian media tends to jump all over any ` bird flu ' related stories . overnight at least a half dozen russian language media reports were published describing a ` suspected ' bird flu outbreak at a large commercial broiler facility in amur oblast , very near the chinese border . a a few ( translated ) headlines read : because of suspicion of avian influenza " amur broiler " scored a million birds " amur broiler " destroyed <NUMERIC> million birds because of the suspicion of avian influenza on the " amur broiler " because of the suspicion of avian influenza scored about a million chickenswhat makes this story unusual is that test results have not confirmed <ALPHANUMERIC> or <ALPHANUMERIC> avian flu , and while <NUMERIC> million chicks have reportedly been destroyed , it isn ' t clear what subtype - if any - was involved . a a some of these reports reference a suspected ` <ALPHANUMERIC> ' outbreak ( presumably <ALPHANUMERIC> but apparently that isn ' t confirmed either . typical of these reports is this from " amur broiler " destroyed <NUMERIC> million birds because of the suspicion of avian influenzaa the presence of the disease has not been confirmed ekaterina dyatlovskaya agroinvestor , august " amur broiler only in the amur region poultry for meat production with a full cycle , destroyed millions of birds <NUMERIC> because of suspected avian influenza . as the press service of the regional government , the enterprise shall be scheduled quarterly samples for bird health , one of them the conclusion was received on august <NUMERIC> , which spoke of suspicion on certain poultry diseases . a a " i have to say that the suspicion of avian influenza type <ALPHANUMERIC> and <ALPHANUMERIC> was not . and these are the main types of avian influenza , which affect on human health - said the deputy chairman of the government of the region vladislav bakumenko . a after analysis of the samples were suspected flu <ALPHANUMERIC> , which is not dangerous to humans , but affects the health of the birds . preventive measures have been taken at the factory , a large part of poultry has been destroyed . in total , taking into account the chicks and poultry , ready to hit on the counter , was disposed of about <NUMERIC> million head . as a result , according to the regional government in the coming months , consumers can not find in stores chilled chicken from the " amur broiler a by results of the first tests were re - sent to study samples from birds they do not detect the virus <ALPHANUMERIC> , <ALPHANUMERIC> and <ALPHANUMERIC> . therefore , i can say that the company has passed the trouble , it will not be closed for long . now there will be activities for cleaning , disinfection , and roughly <NUMERIC> september factory will work in normal mode said bakumenko . a a a a a ( continue the gist of this , and similar reports , is that after culling a million birds , all of the avian flu tests have come back negative . a early tests suggested <ALPHANUMERIC> , but subsequent tests apparently did not provide confirmation . despite these negative findings , the factory will spend the next month cleaning and disinfecting their premises . a visit to russia ' s federal service for veterinary and phytosanitary surveillance website sheds no light on this story , although we may geta a small clue from a different media report which describes some of the extraordinary biosecurity measures utilized by this facility due to its close proximity to china . a a a a a a a a a a ( translation ) amurchane two months remain without chicken " ohlazhdenki " a in the factory , due to suspicion of bird flu killed about a million chicks today , <NUMERIC> : <ALPHANUMERIC> amur region , august <NUMERIC> , the news agency " port amur at six weeks the residents of the amur region will remain chilled chicken . because of the suspicion of avian influenza on the <ALPHANUMERIC> " amur broiler " killed about a million chicks . on monday , the company stopped supplying products to the stores , khabarovsk krai and primorye . at the poultry farm left <NUMERIC> , which will be implemented in two weeks . most of the remains in the amur region . and after the " freezing " of the " amur broiler " temporarily disappear from the shelves snip ) a due to the proximity to china amur enterprise is in a special risk . in the factory , even has its own corporate law : workers advance warning guide on trips to china , and on his return three days in the so - called quarantine - do not go to work . also , all employees " amur broiler " forbidden to keep any bird houses - the same canaries or parrots . a a ( continue while none of this tells us exactly actually caused this poultry facility to take such drastic measures , it does tell us a bit about how worried the russians are that <ALPHANUMERIC> - or <ALPHANUMERIC> - might follow <ALPHANUMERIC> out of china and into russia . for more on their preparations , you may wish to revisit china ' s nervous neighbors . <EOD>

<SOD> credit tottori university # <NUMERIC> , <ALPHANUMERIC> monday , in south korea : gochang hpai <ALPHANUMERIC> a new reassortant virus , we learned ( somewhat cryptically ) that south korea ' s recent outbreak of <ALPHANUMERIC> was not simply a return of last year ' s asian - origin virus , but an entirely new reassortment comprised of last year ' s european <ALPHANUMERIC> virus and the na from a european <ALPHANUMERIC> . today we learn from testing at tottori university that the virus samples collected two weeks ago from shimane prefecture on the east coast of japan ( see japan : moe raises surveillance alert level as more dead birds are discovered ) are a similar reassortant virus . a not only does this announcement provide us with additional details on these genetic changes - by turning up at locations more than <ALPHANUMERIC> apart within days of each other - it suggests this new reassortant virus may be more than just a flash in the pan . first some ( translated ) excerpts from the university ' s press release ( bolding mine then i ' ll return with a bit more . new informationa this season ' s highly pathogenic avian influenza virus domestic first separation new ! a nov <NUMERIC> , list of new informationthis season ' s highly pathogenic avian influenza virus gene properties of first isolates in japan ~ viral origin and virulence ~ overviewin november , the <ALPHANUMERIC> - type highly pathogenic avian influenza virus was first isolated in this season from the corpse of the cobb swan recovered in shimane prefecture . as a result of the analysis of the full - length gene of the virus isolated in the university , the virus has been found to be a different virus from last season ' s domestic strains . the virus was also a gene re - assembly of the waterfowl - derived <ALPHANUMERIC> - type virus , widely distributed in europe and other popular <ALPHANUMERIC> - type viruses in the last season , and was presumed to have invaded the country in the new season . furthermore , the virus ' s genes are not likely to infect people directly because mutations that are considered to be involved in the infection to the person reported so far have not been recognized . backgroundin korea last season , the epidemic of <ALPHANUMERIC> - type highly pathogenic avian influenza virus spread across the country , totaling <NUMERIC> cases , and the largest outbreak in the past over <NUMERIC> million feathers of culled . on the other hand , in japan , at about the same time , it was confirmed that the outbreak occurred at <NUMERIC> farms total of <NUMERIC> road prefectures , and the occurrence of <NUMERIC> cases , which is the largest in the past , was reported in birds and other countries . this <ALPHANUMERIC> - type virus it was discovered for the first time in jiangsu , china in , and it is believed that the next day in , the epidemic spread to southeast asian countries such as viet nam and laos , which have already spread widely in china . on the other hand , in european countries , <ALPHANUMERIC> - type viruses have been prevalent in countries since , and last season , <NUMERIC> countries have already been confirmed as italy and russia in this season . historyon november <NUMERIC> in the trachea and total excretion swab specimens taken from the corpse of the cobb swan found in matsue city , shimane prefecture , the positive response was observed in the type a influenza simple diagnostic kit , the ministry of the environment " it is one of the confirmed diagnostic agencies of avian influenza virus possession survey in birds . at the center for epidemiology of common infectious diseases in the university of tsukuba , the analysis of full - length genes was performed along with the implementation of virus separation , sub - type identification and virulence testing from the same specimen . content and significancethe influenza virus gene consists of eight rnas , called segments , which are called <ALPHANUMERIC> , <ALPHANUMERIC> , pa , ha , np , na , m , and ns genes , depending on the major proteins coded by each gene . the eight genetic segments of this separation virus ( hereafter shimane ) it was found that the homology of the <ALPHANUMERIC> - type domestic epidemic strains of last season was <NUMERIC> % or less , and that this virus was a different virus from last season ' s domestic epidemic addition , seven gene segments other than the na gene of the virus last year showed the highest homology of over <NUMERIC> % with those of <ALPHANUMERIC> - type viruses prevalent in european countries the na gene also showed more than <NUMERIC> % homology with those of the <ALPHANUMERIC> virus derived from wild waterfowl widely distributed in eurasia . from the above , the virus has been found to be a gene re - aggregation virus with the <ALPHANUMERIC> - type virus and wild waterfowl - derived <ALPHANUMERIC> virus prevalent in poultry in europe , etc . last season . according to the method prescribed by the oie ( international world secretariat as a result of the pathogenic test of the chicken in the intravenous inoculation , since the death was confirmed within feathers , it has been confirmed that the virus is highly pathogenic avian influenza virus that indicates a high virulence against chickens . in addition , in the experiment of the infection by the nasal inoculation to chickens considered to be close to the natural infection path , with <NUMERIC> virus shots , all of them died within three days and all of them were left in the <NUMERIC> inoculation group , and the virus was compared to last season ' s domestic stock it was considered to be a virus with the same degree of virulence . when the influenza virus infects cells , the ha protein is adsorbed on the receptor of the cell surface , but it is known that the receptor is different in birds and mammals . the amino acid residues involved in the adsorption of the ha protein in the shimane strain on host cells were an array of specificity for bird - type receptors . in the amino acid sequence of other viral proteins , amino acid substitution was not allowed to acquire the infection to mammals and people . in addition , the amino acid substitution involved in the neuraminidase inhibitor resistance was not observed in the na protein . from the above results , it was estimated that the virus would be less likely to infect people directly . future plansthe gene sequence information of this virus will be released to the international nucleotide sequence database . we will continue to analyze the genetic properties of other domestic isolates and korea isolates , as well as to analyze the antigenic nature of the virus in detail . we will also clarify the sensitivity , virulence , and propagation power of chickens , ducks , and wild baby animals , etc . the results of these researches are expected to lead to an increase in the future of epidemic forecasting and prevention measures continue one of the questions we ' ve been pondering over the summer is exactly what virus would return to europe , asia , and possibly north america with this fall ' s migration . a a during the first three hpai <ALPHANUMERIC> transcontinental waves , and ) hpai <ALPHANUMERIC> was the culprit , and while the clades changed over time , the basic subtype remained stable ( see sept fao empresa watch the fao has pegged the emergence and global spread of hpai <ALPHANUMERIC> as the ` fourth wave of intercontinental movement of <ALPHANUMERIC> hpai virus since - but unlike venerable <ALPHANUMERIC> - this new clade ( <NUMERIC> . <NUMERIC> . <NUMERIC> . <NUMERIC> of <ALPHANUMERIC> has proved itself to be highly promiscuous , spinning off scores of genotypes and multiple subtypes as it has spread across asia and europe . in , hpai <ALPHANUMERIC> reassorted into hpai <ALPHANUMERIC> and a new hpai <ALPHANUMERIC> in north america , as it proceeded to spark the largest avian epizootic in american history . a when <ALPHANUMERIC> returned to europe last winter , it produced a reassortant <ALPHANUMERIC> , which turned up in multiple eu countries , and at least one detection of <ALPHANUMERIC> was reported in greece in late march of this year . a given that the original <ALPHANUMERIC> subtype still circulates and interacts with lpai viruses in europe , africa , and russia - as does asian <ALPHANUMERIC> in china - the genetic diversity of clade <NUMERIC> . <NUMERIC> . <NUMERIC> . <NUMERIC> <ALPHANUMERIC> is only likely to increase over time . a the good news is that viruses spun off from <ALPHANUMERIC> are currently viewed as less likely to infect humans than those with an <ALPHANUMERIC> origin . a that said , we ' ve seen a number of lab studies suggesting that <ALPHANUMERIC> could potentially pick up mammalian adaptations that could increase its threat to humans . vet . research : synergistic aa changes that enhance virulence of <ALPHANUMERIC> in micej . virulence : altered virulence of ( hpai ) <ALPHANUMERIC> reassortant viruses in mammalian modelsstudy : virulence of hpai <ALPHANUMERIC> enhanced by <NUMERIC> amino acid substitutions the bottom line is that avian flu viruses continue to spread and reinvent themselves , and that kind of diversity means we ' ll have to remain alert for changes to both their genetics , and to their behavior . stay tuned . a # <ALPHANUMERIC> _ translate _ tooltip _ mini { display : none ! important <EOD>

qaeda . but in a public ceremony aired on yemeni tv in , abdel - raouf , sultan and another brother announced an accord with the governor of bayda province to force al - qaeda out of the area . just before the raid , abdel - raouf was in the neighboring province of marib , meeting with the military chief of staff in hadias government . the meeting was confirmed by al - dhahabas top aide , fahd al - qasi , who accompanied him , and two military officials who witnessed or helped arrange the meeting . the two officials spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the meeting . during five days of talks with the military , al - dhahab a who commands a force of some <NUMERIC> tribal fighters a was given around <NUMERIC> million yemeni riyals <NUMERIC> , <NUMERIC> ) to pay his men in the fight against the houthis , al - qasi and the two officials said . he returned home to yakla and the evening before the raid , al -

dhahab clan is a powerful force in bayda province , originally made up of <NUMERIC> brothers and half - brothers . the family had long been split in a struggle for leadership , with one part joining al - qaeda . at least three of the brothers were senior al - qaeda figures , two of them killed in us drone strikes and a third , tareq , killed in a family dispute . giving al - qaeda further leverage in the family , one of the sisters was married to anwar al - awlaki , a yemeni - american who was the branchas top propagandist until he was killed in a drone strike . but abdel - raouf , who became the clanas leader in after tareqas death , repeatedly denied belonging to al - qaeda . he was mistrusted by al - qaeda because he didnat swear allegiance to its leader and had links to the government , according to a relative and a prominent figure from another tribe in the area . they spoke to the ap on condition of anonymity for fear of trouble with the terror group . hadias government spokesman , rageh badi , did not reply to the apas request for comment . ap e - mails to the vice presidentas office also received no officials did not immediately reply to queries whether planners were aware of al - dhahabas link to hadias government . since al - qaedaas branch in yemen began in , it has sought to strengthen alliances with the countryas tribes , using money , family connections and fear . some tribes join it , some use it against rivals , some cooperate with it , and some shun it . some tribes split . complicating matters further , al - qaeda militants have been fighting the shiite rebels since informally alongside pro - hadi forces . they often operate closely with ultraconservative islamist militias funded by hadias allies saudi arabia and the united arab emirates . that has enabled them to move back into areas they were previously driven out of , including bayda province . the ap spoke to eight witnesses and survivors of the raid , along with several prominent local tribal figures . according to their accounts , it began around <NUMERIC> : <NUMERIC> a . m . when us special forces descended on yakla , in a sparsely populated area of bayda province . fighters in the village opened fire , and a battle erupted , with aerial bombardment and firing from attack helicopters . fighting lasted several hours and at least three houses were destroyed . anothing survived , even the cows and the sheep were shot dead , a said sheikh ahmed al - salami , who lived not far from al - dhahab and was among the villagers who got out their personal weapons to fight back against the attackers . the center of the raid appeared to be six houses belonging to al - dhahab family and abdullah mabkhout al - ameri , head of another prominent local family . one of al - amerias sons , mohammed , an al - qaeda member , was home at the time of the raid , according to several villagers . also staying in an annex to the house were the fugitive saudi female jihadi , arwa al - baghdadi , her brother a also an al - qaeda militant a and his pregnant wife and their niece . the tribal leaders and officials said they believed mohammed had housed them . all but the niece were killed . caught in the al -
